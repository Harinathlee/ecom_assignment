The build is optimized for production by using techniques such as code splitting, tree shaking, and minification. These techniques reduce the bundle size and improve load times.

#### 2. What are some performance optimization techniques you used in your project?
I implemented lazy loading for components, optimized images, and used memoization techniques to prevent unnecessary re-renders, which significantly improved the application's performance.

### Error Handling

#### 1. How do you handle error boundaries in React?
Error boundaries are implemented using the `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method or the `static getDerivedStateFromError` method in class components. They catch JavaScript errors in their child component tree and display a fallback UI.

#### 2. Explain a tricky bug you encountered during development and how you resolved it.
I encountered a bug where the application crashed due to an unhandled promise rejection. I resolved it by implementing proper error handling in asynchronous functions and using error boundaries to catch errors in the UI.

### Dependencies and Environment
